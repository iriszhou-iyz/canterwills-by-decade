procedure-notes

i first imported the relevant libraries - pandas for data cleaning and processing and matplotlib for plotting the chart. i cleaned the data by sorting in ascending order of years. i then created a counter function to create the list of values for the x- and y-axes. finally, I plotted the data in a bar graph and adjusted the settings such that it is easy-to-read.
